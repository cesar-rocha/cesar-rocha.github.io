      <p>The combination of oceanographic processes and a negligible fluvial terrestrial sediment contribution makes the Santos Basin margin (southwestern Brazil) a unique environment for studying thew morphological imprint of bottom currents on the seafloor morphology. We divide the seafloor into four domains: outer shelf, upper, middle, and lower slope, based on an analysis of sub-bottom Chirp profiles, multichannel seismic data, hydrographic data, numerical simulation outputs, and a seismic-derived bathymetry map. A clinoform at the outer shelf and upper slope, topped by erosional morphologies, developed below the SW-flowing Brazil Current (BC). At the bottom of the upper slope, a rugged and mounded surface around 600 mbsl coincides with the current flow reversal to the underlying NE-flowing Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC). The smooth middle slope exhibits sheeted contourites interrupted by occasional channel-and-mound complexes.

From the middle slope base, salt tectonics becomes a major player in setting the seafloor morphology. The slope-parallel Santos Channel develops above a subsurface diapir and the Cabo Frio Fault. The latter divides between the landward gap in subsurface Albian salt and the basinward rich diapir realm. Hence, the lower slope is reworked by the SW-flowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC); however, salt tectonics dictates its morphology. Our study consists of a unique example for studying the morpho-sedimentary imprint of a counter-current flowing on the continental slope and also for exploring the interaction between bottom flows with a suite of endogenic processes, such as salt tectonics, fluid flows, and mass movements.</p>

      <p>A multiscale reduced description of turbulent free shear flows in
  the presence of strong stabilizing density stratification is derived via
  asymptotic analysis of the Boussinesq equations in the simultaneous limits of
  small Froude and large Reynolds numbers. The analysis explicitly recognizes
  the occurrence of dynamics on disparate spatiotemporal scales, yielding
  simplified partial differential equations governing the coupled evolution of
  slow large-scale hydrostatic flows and fast small-scale isotropic
  instabilities and internal waves. The dynamics captured by the coupled
  reduced equations is illustrated in the context of two-dimensional strongly
  stratified Kolmogorov flow. A noteworthy feature of the reduced model is that
  the fluctuations are constrained to satisfy quasilinear (QL) dynamics about
  the comparably slowly varying large-scale fields. Crucially, this QL
  reduction is not invoked as an ad hoc closure approximation, but rather is
  derived in a physically relevant and mathematically consistent distinguished
  limit. Further analysis of the resulting slow–fast QL system shows how the
  amplitude of the fast stratified-shear instabilities is slaved to the slowly
  evolving mean fields to ensure the marginal stability of the latter.
  Physically, this marginal stability condition appears to be compatible with
  recent evidence of self-organized criticality in both observations and
  simulations of stratified turbulence. Algorithmically, the slaving of the
  fluctuation fields enables numerical simulations to be time-evolved strictly
  on the slow time scale of the hydrostatic flow. The reduced equations thus
  provide a solid mathematical foundation for future studies of
  three-dimensional strongly stratified turbulence in extreme parameter regimes
  of geophysical relevance and suggest avenues for new sub-grid-scale
  parametrizations.</p>

      <p>Kinetic energy associated with inertia-gravity waves (IGWs) and other ageostrophic phenomena often overwhelms kinetic energy due to geostrophic motions for wavelengths on the order of tens of kilometers. Understanding the dependencies of the wavelength at which balanced (geostrophic) variability ceases to be larger than unbalanced variability is important for interpreting high-resolution altimetric data. This wavelength has been termed the transition scale. This study uses Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data along with auxiliary observations and a numerical model to investigate the transition scale in the eastern tropical Pacific and the mechanisms responsible for its regional and seasonal variations. One-dimensional kinetic energy wavenumber spectra are separated into rotational and divergent components, and subsequently into vortex and wave components. The divergent motions, most-likely predominantly IGWs, account for most of the energy at wavelengths less than 100 km. The observed regional and seasonal patterns in the transition scale are consistent with those from a high-resolution global simulation. Observations, however, show weaker seasonality, with only modest wintertime increases in vortex energy. The ADCP-inferred IGW wavenumber spectra suggest that waves with near-inertial frequency dominate the unbalanced variability, while in model output, internal tides strongly influence the wavenumber spectrum. The ADCP-derived transition scales from the eastern tropical Pacific are typically in the 100–200 km range.</p>

      <p>Recent studies suggest that the South Brazil Bight (SBB) hosts strong westward propagating mesoscale eddies. We use 28 years of satellite altimetry data and a new Eddy Atlas to estimate how much of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) observed in the SBB is accounted for by local eddies, generated in the Brazil Current (BC) region, versus remote eddies generated eastward of the BC region. First, we estimate a BC frontal density to obtain a robust definition of BC region. The BC front is well-defined throughout the SBB, occupying the region between the 200-m and 1000-m isobath, except in eddy hotspots downstream of sharp inflections of the continental slope, where the EKE far exceeds the mean kinetic energy (MKE). Compact, closed-contour mesoscale eddies account for 30–50% of the total EKE observed in the SBB, with local eddies accounting for most of the compact EKE in the BC region, defined as the area within 200 km of the 28-year mean BC front. Remote compact eddies account for less than 10% of the EKE observed in the BC region; compact eddies generated at long distances from the SBB, including eddies generated in the Southeastern Atlantic, contribute an insignificant fraction of EKE in the BC region.</p>

      <p>South of the Vitoria-Trindade Ridge, a seamount chain off East
  Brazil, the Brazil Current (BC) meanders cyclonically within Tubarão Bight,
  occasionally forming the Vitória Eddy. It was recently found that the
  Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC), which flows equatorward below
  the BC, cyclonically recirculate within Tubarão Bight. We present an analysis
  of AVISO observations that suggest that the Vitória Eddy formation is
  conditioned by the strength of the BC upstream of Tubarão Bight. A weak BC is
  prone to local meandering and eddy formation in the bight, while a strong BC
  suppresses eddy formation in the bight but triggers downstream meander
  growth. To study the effects of the IWBC recirculation on the BC meandering
  and the Vitória Eddy formation, we formulate a simple two-layer
  quasi-geostrophic model. In the model, the BC is represented by a meridional
  jet in the upper layer and the IWBC recirculation is a steady eddy in the
  lower layer. The lower-layer eddy effectively acts as a topographic bump,
  affecting the upper-layer jet via the stretching term psi2/R2d, where psi2 is
  the lower-layer streamfunction and Rd is the baroclinic deformation radius.
  Based on the AVISO sea-surface height data and previous observational studies,
  we define a stationary eddy and reference jet. We conduct a number of initial-value
  problem experiments varying the upper-layer jet speed. A weak upper-layer jet
  slowly meanders and develops a cyclone above the lower-layer eddy. As we increase
  the jet velocity, the meandering is faster and the cyclone is larger. But a too-strong
  jet has an opposite effect: the potential vorticity anomalies induced by the lower-layer
  eddy are quickly swept away, leading to explosive downstream meander growth; no
  cyclone is formed above the lower-layer eddy. In all cases, the initial meandering
  trigger is a linear process (the steering of the upper-layer jet by the lower-layer eddy).
  But even when the upper-layer jet is weak, nonlinearity quickly becomes important,
  dominating the dynamics after 10 days of simulation. The downstream meander growth
  is fully nonlinear. Our idealized QG model confirms that the IWBC recirculation
  can trigger the Vitória Eddy formation and elucidates the mechanisms involved in this process.</p>

      <p>The science guiding the EUREC4A campaign and its measurements are presented. EUREC4A comprised roughly five weeks of measurements in the downstream winter trades of the North Atlantic – eastward and south-eastward of Barbados. Through its ability to characterize processes operating across a wide range of scales, EUREC4A marked a turning point in our ability to observationally study factors influencing clouds in the trades, how they will respond to warming, and their link to other components of the earth system, such as upper-ocean processes or, or the life-cycle of particulate matter. This characterization was made possible by thousands (2500) of sondes distributed to measure circulations on meso (200 km) and larger (500 km) scales, roughly four hundred hours of flight time by four heavily instrumented research aircraft, four global-ocean class research vessels, an advanced ground-based cloud observatory, a flotilla of autonomous or tethered measurement devices operating in the upper ocean (nearly 10000 profiles), lower atmosphere (continuous profiling), and along the air-sea interface, a network of water stable isotopologue measurements, complemented by special programmes of satellite remote sensing and modeling with a new generation of weather/climate models. In addition to providing an outline of the novel measurements and their composition into a unified and coordinated campaign, the six distinct scientific facets that EUREC4A explored – from Brazil Ring Current Eddies to turbulence induced clustering of cloud droplets and its influence on warm-rain formation – are presented along with an overview EUREC4A’s outreach activities, environmental impact, and guidelines for scientific practice.</p>

      <p>In this study, we interpret the role played by ocean circulation in sediment distribution on the southwestern Atlantic margin using radiogenic Nd and Pb isotopes. The latitudinal trends for Pb and Nd isotopes reflect the different current systems acting on the margin. The utilization of the sediment fingerprinting method allowed us to associate the isotopic signatures with the main oceanographic features in the area. We recognized differences between Nd and Pb sources to the Argentinean shelf (carried by the flow of Subantarctic Shelf Water) and slopes (transported by deeper flows). Sediments from Antarctica extend up to the Uruguayan margin, carried by the Upper and Lower Circumpolar Deep Water. Our data confirm that, for shelf and intermediate areas (the upper 1200 m), the transfer of sediments from the Argentinean margin to the north of 35∘ S is limited by the Subtropical Shelf Front and the basin-wide recirculated Antarctic Intermediate Water.

On the southern Brazilian inner and middle shelf, it is possible to recognize the northward influence of the Río de la Plata sediments carried by the Plata Plume Water. Another flow responsible for sediment transport and deposition on the outer shelf and slope is the southward flow of the Brazil Current. Finally, we propose that the Brazil–Malvinas Confluence and the Santos Bifurcation act as boundaries of geochemical provinces in the area. A conceptual model of sediment sources and transport is provided for the southwestern Atlantic margin.</p>

      <p>For the problem of horizontal convection the Nusselt number based on entropy production is bounded from above by CRa1/3 as the horizontal convective Rayleigh number Ra → ∞ for some constant C (Siggers et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 517, 2004, pp. 55–70). We re-examine the variational arguments leading to this ‘ultimate regime’ by using the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin method to solve the variational problem in the Ra → ∞ limit and exhibiting solutions that achieve the ultimate Ra1/3 scaling. As expected, the optimizing flows have a boundary layer of thickness ∼Ra−1/3 pressed against the non-uniformly heated surface; but the variational solutions also have rapid oscillatory variation with wavelength ∼Ra−1/3 along the wall. As a result of the exact solution of the variational problem, the constant C is smaller than the previous estimate by a factor of 2.5 for no-slip and 1.6 for no-stress boundary conditions. This modest reduction in C indicates that the inequalities used by Siggers et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 517, 2004, pp. 55–70) are surprisingly accurate.</p>

      <p>In the problem of horizontal convection a non-uniform buoyancy, bs(x,y), is imposed on the top surface of a container and all other surfaces are insulating. Horizontal convection produces a net horizontal flux of buoyancy, J, defined by vertically and temporally averaging the interior horizontal flux of buoyancy. We show that J · ∇bs = −κ⟨|∇b|2⟩; the overbar denotes a space–time average over the top surface, angle brackets denote a volume–time average and κ is the molecular diffusivity of buoyancy b. This connection between J and κ⟨|∇b|2⟩ justifies the definition of the horizontal-convective Nusselt number, Nu, as the ratio of κ⟨|∇b|2⟩ to the corresponding quantity produced by molecular diffusion alone. We discuss the advantages of this definition of Nu over other definitions of horizontal-convective Nusselt number. We investigate transient effects and show that κ⟨|∇b|2⟩ equilibrates more rapidly than other global averages, such as the averaged kinetic energy and bottom buoyancy. We show that κ⟨|∇b|2⟩ is the volume-averaged rate of Boussinesq entropy production within the enclosure. In statistical steady state, the interior entropy production is balanced by a flux through the top surface. This leads to an equivalent ‘surface Nusselt number’, defined as the surface average of vertical buoyancy flux through the top surface times the imposed surface buoyancy bs(x,y). In experimental situations it is easier to evaluate the surface entropy flux, rather than the volume integral of |∇b|2 demanded by κ⟨|∇b|2⟩.</p>

      <p>As observations and models improve their resolution of oceanic motions at ever finer horizontal scales, interest has grown in characterizing the transition from the geostrophically balanced flows that dominate at large‐scale to submesoscale turbulence and waves that dominate at small scales. In this study we examine the mesoscale‐to‐submesoscale (100 to 10 km) transition in an eastern boundary current, the southern California Current System (CCS), using repeated acoustic Doppler current profiler transects, sea surface height from high‐resolution nadir altimetry and output from a (1/48)° global model simulation. In the CCS, the submesoscale is as energetic as in western boundary current regions, but the mesoscale is much weaker, and as a result the transition lacks the change in kinetic energy (KE) spectral slope observed for western boundary currents. Helmholtz and vortex‐wave decompositions of the KE spectra are used to identify balanced and unbalanced contributions. At horizontal scales greater than 70 km, we find that observed KE is dominated by balanced geostrophic motions. At scales from 40 to 10 km, unbalanced contributions such as inertia‐gravity waves contribute as much as balanced motions. The model KE transition occurs at longer scales, around 125 km. The altimeter spectra are consistent with acoustic Doppler current profiler/model spectra at scales longer than 70/125 km, respectively. Observed seasonality is weak. Taken together, our results suggest that geostrophic velocities can be diagnosed from sea surface height on scales larger than about 70 km in the southern CCS.</p>

      <p>Recently Nakamura and Huang proposed a semiempirical, one-dimensional model of atmospheric blocking based on the observed budget of local wave activity in the boreal winter. The model dynamics is akin to that of traffic flow, wherein blocking manifests as traffic jams when the streamwise flux of local wave activity reaches capacity. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream’s capacity to transmit transient waves and thereby localize block formation. Since the model is inexpensive to run numerically, it is suited for computing blocking statistics as a function of climate variables from large-ensemble, parameter sweep experiments. We explore sensitivity of blocking statistics to (i) stationary wave amplitude, (ii) background jet speed, and (iii) transient eddy forcing, using frequency, persistence, and prevalence as metrics. For each combination of parameters we perform 240 runs of 180-day simulations with aperiodic transient eddy forcing, each time randomizing the phase relations in forcing. The model climate shifts rapidly from a block-free state to a block-dominant state as the stationary wave amplitude is increased and/or the jet speed is decreased. When eddy forcing is increased, prevalence increases similarly but frequency decreases as blocks merge and become more persistent. It is argued that the present-day climate lies close to the boundary of the two states and hence its blocking statistics are sensitive to climate perturbations. The result underscores the low confidence in GCM-based assessment of the future trend of blocking under a changing climate, while it also provides a theoretical basis for evaluating model biases and understanding trends in reanalysis data.</p>

      <p>The Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC) transports Antarctic Intermediate Water across the Vitória–Trindade Ridge (VTR), a seamount chain at ;208S off Brazil. Recent studies suggest that the IWBC develops a strong cyclonic recirculation in Tubarão Bight, upstream of the VTR, with weak time dependency. We herein use new quasi-synoptic observations, data from the Argo array, and a regional numerical model to describe the structure and variability of the IWBC and to investigate its dynamics. Both shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data and trajectories of Argo floats confirm the existence of the IWBC recirculation, which is also captured by our Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) simulation. An ‘‘intermediate-layer’’ quasigeostrophic (QG) model indicates that the ROMS time-mean flow is a good proxy for the IWBC steady state, as revealed by largely parallel isolines of streamfunction c and potential vorticity Q; a c 2 Q scatter diagram also shows that the IWBC is potentially unstable. Further analysis of the ROMS simulation reveals that remotely generated, westward-propagating nonlinear eddies are the main source of variability in the region. These eddies enter the domain through the Tubarão Bight eastern edge and strongly interact with the IWBC. As they are advected downstream and negotiate the local topography, the eddies grow explosively through horizontal shear production.</p>

      <p>We study stimulated generation – the transfer of energy from balanced flows to existing internal waves – using an asymptotic model that couples barotropic quasi-geostrophic flow and near-inertial waves with eimz vertical structure, where m is the vertical wavenumber and z is the vertical coordinate. A detailed description of the conservation laws of this vertical-plane-wave model illuminates the mechanism of stimulated generation associated with vertical vorticity and lateral strain. There are two sources of wave potential energy, and corresponding sinks of balanced kinetic energy: the refractive convergence of wave action density into anti-cyclones (and divergence from cyclones); and the enhancement of wave-field gradients by geostrophic straining. We quantify these energy transfers and describe the phenomenology of stimulated generation using numerical solutions of an initially uniform inertial oscillation interacting with mature freely evolving two-dimensional turbulence. In all solutions, stimulated generation co-exists with a transfer of balanced kinetic energy to large scales via vortex merging. Also, geostrophic straining accounts for most of the generation of wave potential energy, representing a sink of 10%–20% of the initial balanced kinetic energy. However, refraction is fundamental because it creates the initial eddy-scale lateral gradients in the near-inertial field that are then enhanced by advection. In these quasi-inviscid solutions, wave dispersion is the only mechanism that upsets stimulated generation: with a barotropic balanced flow, lateral straining enhances the wave group velocity, so that waves accelerate and rapidly escape from straining regions. This wave escape prevents wave energy from cascading to dissipative scales.</p>

      <p>Tidal currents and large‐scale oceanic currents are known to modify ocean wave properties, causing extreme sea states that are a hazard to navigation. Recent advances in the understanding and modeling capability of open ocean currents have revealed the ubiquitous presence of eddies, fronts, and filaments at scales 10–100 km. Based on realistic numerical models, we show that these structures can be the main source of variability in significant wave heights at scales less than 200 km, including important variations down to 10 km. Model results are consistent with wave height variations along satellite altimeter tracks, resolved at scales larger than 50 km. The spectrum of significant wave heights is found to be of the order of  urn:x-wiley:21699275:media:jgrc22271:jgrc22271-math-0001 times the current spectrum, where  urn:x-wiley:21699275:media:jgrc22271:jgrc22271-math-0002 is the spatially averaged significant wave height,  urn:x-wiley:21699275:media:jgrc22271:jgrc22271-math-0003 is the energy‐averaged period, and g is the gravity acceleration. This variability induced by currents has been largely overlooked in spite of its relevance for extreme wave heights and remote sensing.</p>

      <p>This study investigates the representation of solutions of the three-dimensional quasigeostrophic (QG) equations using Galerkin series with standard vertical modes, with particular attention to the incorporation of active surface buoyancy dynamics. This study extends two existing Galerkin approaches (A and B) and develops a new Galerkin approximation (C). Approximation A, due to Flierl, represents the streamfunction as a truncated Galerkin series and defines the potential vorticity (PV) that satisfies the inversion problem exactly. Approximation B, due to Tulloch and Smith, represents the PV as a truncated Galerkin series and calculates the streamfunction that satisfies the inversion problem exactly. Approximation C, the true Galerkin approximation for the QG equations, represents both streamfunction and PV as truncated Galerkin series but does not satisfy the inversion equation exactly. The three approximations are fundamentally different unless the boundaries are isopycnal surfaces. The authors discuss the advantages and limitations of approximations A, B, and C in terms of mathematical rigor and conservation laws and illustrate their relative efficiency by solving linear stability problems with nonzero surface buoyancy. With moderate number of modes, B and C have superior accuracy than A at high wavenumbers. Because B lacks the conservation of energy, this study recommends approximation C for constructing solutions to the surface active QG equations using the Galerkin series with standard vertical modes.</p>

      <p>This study discusses the upper-ocean (0–200 m) horizontal wavenumber spectra in the Drake Passage from 13 yr of shipboard ADCP measurements, altimeter data, and a high-resolution numerical simulation. At scales between 10 and 200 km, the ADCP kinetic energy spectra approximately follow a k−3 power law. The observed flows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, significantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The inconsistency is dramatic at scales smaller than 40 km. A Helmholtz decomposition of the ADCP spectra and analyses of synthetic and numerical model data show that horizontally divergent, ageostrophic flows account for the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. In Drake Passage, ageostrophic motions appear to be dominated by inertia–gravity waves and account for about half of the near-surface kinetic energy at scales between 10 and 40 km. Model results indicate that ageostrophic flows imprint on the sea surface, accounting for about half of the sea surface height variance between 10 and 40 km.</p>

      <p>Recent studies show that the vigorous seasonal cycle of the mixed layer modulates upper ocean submesoscale turbulence. Here we provide model‐based evidence that the seasonally changing upper ocean stratification in the Kuroshio Extension also modulates submesoscale (here 10–100 km) inertia‐gravity waves. Summertime restratification weakens submesoscale turbulence but enhances inertia‐gravity waves near the surface. Thus, submesoscale turbulence and inertia‐gravity waves undergo vigorous out‐of‐phase seasonal cycles. These results imply a strong seasonal modulation of the accuracy of geostrophic velocity diagnosed from submesoscale sea surface height delivered by the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission.</p>

      <p> We use four current meter moorings and quasi‐synoptic hydrographic observations in conjunction with a one‐dimensional quasi‐geostrophic linear stability model to investigate downstream changes in the Brazil Current (BC) System between 22°S and 28°S. The data set depict the downstream thickening of the BC. Its vertical extension increases from 350 m at 22.7°S to 850 m at 27.9°S. Most of this deepening occurs between 25.5°S and 27.9°S and is linked to the bifurcation of the South Equatorial Current at intermediate depths (Santos bifurcation), which adds the Antarctic Intermediate Water flow to the BC. Geostrophic estimates suggest that the BC transport is increased by at least 4.3 Sv (∼70%) to the south of that bifurcation. Moreover, the Santos bifurcation is associated with a substantial increase in the barotropic component of the BC System. On average, the water column average kinetic energy (IKE) is 70% baroclinic to the north and 54% barotropic to the south of the bifurcation. Additionally, the BC shows conspicuous mesoscale activity off southeast Brazil. The water column average eddy kinetic energy accounts for 30–60% of the IKE. Instabilities of the mean flow may give rise to these mesoscale fluctuations. Indeed, the linear stability analysis suggests that the BC System is baroclinically unstable between 22°S and 28°S. In particular, the model predicts southwestward‐propagating fastest growing waves (∼190 km) from 25.5°S to 27.9°S and quasi‐standing most unstable modes (∼230 km) at 22.7°S. These modes have vertical structures roughly consistent with the observed eddy field.</p>

      <p>We investigate whether the Quasi‐geostrophic (QG) modes and the Surface Quasi‐geostrophic (SQG) solutions are consistent with the vertical structure of the subinertial variability off southeast Brazil. The first‐order empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of current meter time series is reconstructed using different QG mode combinations; the first EOF is compared against SQG solutions. At two out of three moorings, the traditional flat‐bottom barotropic (BT) and first baroclinic (BC1) mode combination fails to represent the observed sharp near‐surface decay, although this combination contains up to 78% of the depth‐integrated variance. A mesoscale broad‐band combination of flat‐bottom SQG solutions is consistent with the near‐surface sharp decay, accounting for up to 85% of the first EOF variance. A higher‐order QG mode combination is also consistent with the data. Similar results are obtained for a rough topography scenario, in which the velocity vanishes at the bottom. The projection of the SQG solutions onto the QG modes confirms that these two models are mutually dependent. Consequently, as far as the observed near‐surface vertical structure is concerned, SQG solutions and four‐QG mode combination are indistinguishable. Tentative explanations for such vertical structures are given in terms of necessary conditions for baroclinic instability. “Charney‐like” instabilities, or, surface‐intensified “Phillips‐like” instabilities may explain the SQG‐like solutions at two moorings; traditional “Phillips‐like” instabilities may rationalize the BT/BC1 mode representation at the third mooring. These results point out to the presence of a richer subinertial near‐surface dynamics in some regions, which should be considered for the interpretation and projection of remotely sensed surface fields to depth.</p>
