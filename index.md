I'm an oceanographer at the [Universidade  de São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br) (USP), in Brazil. With financial support from [FAPESP](https://fapesp.br/en), [Instituto Serrapilheira](https://serrapilheira.org/en/) and [Pró-Reitoria de Pesquisa](https://sites.usp.br/prp/), I'm bulding the f-lab (Multiscale Ocean & Climate Physics Laboratory)---my research group at USP.

Originally from São Paulo and a graduate of USP, I earned in 2018 a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu), University of California San Diego. Prior to returning to USP as faculty, in 2023, I did a postdoc at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu) (2018-2020) and spent 2.5 years as faculty at [University of Connecticut](https://www.uconn.edu) (2020-2023).

### Opportunities

I'm always looking for motivated people to work with. Please, email me if you'd like to join my group or collaborate on a project.

I'm actively recruiting a **postdoc** and **graduate students** with strong background in physics, math and programming. No previous experience with Oceanography or GFD required. Email me if interested.
